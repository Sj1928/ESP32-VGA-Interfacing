# ESP32-VGA-Interfacing
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of an ESP32 microcontroller with a VGA display, creating an interactive and visually engaging interface. Through the use of the ESP32Video library, we were able to display text and graphical content on a 320x240 VGA screen.

The ESP32 is a powerful, low-cost microcontroller with dual-core processing (up to 240 MHz), 520 KB
SRAM, and support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (4.2 BLE). It features 34 GPIO pins, 12-bit ADC, PWM, DAC,
and multiple communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART). The ESP32 has low power consumption, with
deep sleep modes consuming less than 10 ÂµA, making it ideal for battery-powered projects. It's
supported by development environments like Arduino IDE and MicroPython, and is widely used in IoT,
smart devices, and embedded systems

VGA (Video Graphics Array) is an analog video display standard introduced by IBM in 1987. It became
one of the most widely used video display standards for computer monitors, especially during the
1990s.
The standard VGA resolution is 640x480 pixels with 16 colors (from a palette of 256) or 256 colors in
the 320x200 resolution mode. VGA uses analog signals for transmitting video data (separate red, green,
blue color channels and synchronization signals). The VGA connector typically has 15 pins in a D-sub
(DB-15) configuration, with pins for red, green, blue, horizontal and vertical sync signals, ground, and
power.
