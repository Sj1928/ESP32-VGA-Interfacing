# ESP32-VGA-Interfacing
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of an ESP32 microcontroller with a VGA display, creating an interactive and visually engaging interface. Through the use of the ESP32Video library, we were able to display text and graphical content on a 320x240 VGA screen.
